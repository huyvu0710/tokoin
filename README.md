# TOKOIN CODE CHALLENGE

Using the provided data (tickets.json and users.json and organization.json)

Write a simple command line application to search the data and return the results in a human readable format.

- Feel free to use libraries or roll your own code as you see fit.
- Where the data exists, values from any related entities MUST be included in the results, i.e.
- Searching organization MUST return its ticket subject and users name.
- Searching users MUST return his/her assignee ticket subject and submitted ticket subject and his/her organization name.
- Searching tickets MUST return its assignee name, submitter name, and organization name.
- The user should be able to search on any field, full value matching is fine (e.g. "mar" won't return "mary").
- The user should also be able to search for empty values, e.g. where description is empty.
- Search can get pretty complicated pretty easily, we just want to see that you can code a basic search application.

## Introduction

[![ava.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Rhw6PQLB/ava.png)](https://postimg.cc/8fPzcvYK)

A website code challenge from Tokoin.

Frontend: Angular

Backend: Java, use Spring Boot framework

Platform: JHipster

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    npm start

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the tokoin application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean verify

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.jar

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw verify

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
